## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

My major learnings while working through this project concepts like selectors, buttons, anchor tags and mouse hovering.

T code snippets, see below:

```html
<button><a href="https://github.com/mcquest72" target="_blank">GitHub</a></button>
```
```css
button {
    background-color: #222324; 
    color: #fff; 
    display: flex;
    border-radius: 10px;
    margin: auto;
    padding: 10px 20px; 
    border: none; 
    cursor: pointer;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    width: 90%;
    text-align: center;
}

button:hover, button:hover a {
    background-color: rgb(196, 196, 26);
    color: black;
}


a{
    text-decoration: none;
    color: white;
}
```


### Continued development

I will like to continue focusing on responsive design in future projects. This concepts is new to me and am not completely comfortable with it, although I found responsive design useful which is necessary skill for me to refine and perfect.


### Useful resources

- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me gain some insight to the structure of html. I really liked this platform and will use it going forward.
